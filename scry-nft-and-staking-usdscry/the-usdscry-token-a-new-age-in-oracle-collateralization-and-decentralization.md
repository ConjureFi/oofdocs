# The $SCRY Token: A New Age in Oracle Collateralization and Decentralization

In the expanding world of decentralized finance and smart contracts, ensuring the integrity and security of data is of paramount importance. Oracles have long been the cornerstone for bringing real-world data on-chain, but their operation comes with a certain level of risk. This is where $SCRY, a novel token, plays a crucial role. It is at the heart of an ecosystem designed to foster a more robust and trustworthy environment for oracles, providing a permissionless, decentralized platform where honesty pays off.

### What is the $SCRY Token?

$SCRY is a unique token designed for use in the Morpheus framework. This protocol enables developers to make on-chain requests from any API in web2 for their web3 apps. The $SCRY token is used as a form of collateral in this system, staked by oracles to ensure the accurate provision of data. This economic stake serves as an insurance mechanism: oracles providing incorrect data risk getting their staked tokens slashed by a designated committee.

This system creates a scalable model for revenue generation and security. Oracles, by staking $SCRY, collateralize their data provision services. In return, they earn fees for fulfilling data requests. The more demand for data, the more collateral is required, thereby increasing the security of the entire system.

### Optional Collateralization: Flexibility and Freedom

Importantly, staking $SCRY tokens for collateralization is an entirely optional process. This freedom of choice underscores the core fundamentals of the Morpheus protocol, supporting permissionless nodes and contracts. Oracles can choose to stake based on their confidence in the accuracy of the data they provide, creating an open and competitive marketplace of trust. Oracles are not mandated to stake tokens, maintaining the permissionless nature of nodes and contracts in the Morpheus ecosystem. This design means that the system remains open and inclusive, allowing for broader participation while preserving the system's trustworthiness.

### Enhanced Security Measures: Delegation and Time-Locks

The $SCRY system introduces a delegation mechanism, allowing oracles to create contracts that stake on their behalf. This feature rewards those who stake towards an oracle by providing them with a cut of the oracle's fees, aligning incentives and promoting a secure and robust data environment.

Security is further reinforced through a seven-day delay on unstaking and withdrawals. This mechanism ensures that rogue oracles cannot provide faulty data and immediately withdraw their assets, as they could be slashed during this period. This lock-in period provides a buffer that can potentially deter malicious actors and ensure system integrity.

### Creating a More Connected Ecosystem

In addition to these features, the Morpheus protocol allows oracles to set key-value pairs, a feature that can be used to specify supported networks and provide other general information. This aids in creating a more transparent and connected ecosystem. It is also possible for oracles to include contact details, enabling users to communicate securely with oracles as required, strengthening the trust relationship between data providers and users.

For enhanced security, the staking mechanism in Morpheus permits users to stake tokens towards an oracle from a separate address. This separation between the oracle and its stakes adds an extra layer of security to the data environment, minimizing the risk of compromise.

### Conclusion

$SCRY and the Morpheus protocol are set to revolutionize the way oracles operate in the blockchain sphere. By incentivizing honest data provision, facilitating stake delegation, and implementing robust security measures, the protocol creates an environment where trust is rewarded, and users can be confident in the data they utilize. As a result, the potential for blockchain-based applications and smart contracts is extended further, opening up new possibilities in the world of decentralized finance and beyond.
